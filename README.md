# Hate Speech/Toxicity Detection in Tweets

Social media has not only become an integral part of our
lives but is also a medium to express our thoughts. Twitter, being
most widely used, is host to massive and unfiltered feed of tweets
which have a huge impact. The tweets that include hate speech are
alarming, when they are directed towards an individual or a
group, thus creating an urgency to develop effective
countermeasures. 

This project aims at classifying such tweets into
hate speech or non-hate speech by using various classification
approaches such as Na√Øve Bayes, Linear Support Vector Machine,
XGBoost, Long Short Term Memory and Logistic Regression and
monitor hate trends by identifying its characteristics based on
various parameters. 

This would not only help to reduce hate
against certain ethnic group/individual but also perform
predictive policing.
